I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Biostatistics at Columbia University, advised by Dr. Qixuan Chen and Dr. Liangyuan Hu. Before coming to Columbia, I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Software Engineering.

My research focuses on the development and application of Bayesian methods, particularly in the areas of missing data, causal inference, and survey analysis. I am also interested in advancing computational tools for efficient Bayesian analysis, with the goal of making these methods more practical and scalable for applied research in biostatistics.
