Background: Successful collaborative care (CC) implementation requires enhanced implementation support and fiscal strategies. Even when implemented with high fidelity, emerging data suggest that CC reach diminishes over time. Few if any prior studies have examined predictors of long-term reach and clinical improvement rates.

Methods: From 2012-2015, New York State (NYS) Office of Mental Health (OMH) implemented CC in 32 early adopter clinics before launching the CC Medicaid Program (CCMP) to scale and sustain CC efforts using technical assistance, quality monitoring (of fidelity, clinical improvement, and enrollment rates), training and fee-for-quality Medicaid reimbursement codes. We analyzed clinics that enrolled in the CCMP program from 2012-2019, provided at least 1 quarterâ€™s worth of quality metrics in 2021 and/or 2022, and had >=0.5 full time equivalent (FTE) care manager. We fit multilevel negative binomial regression models, adjusting for clustering by healthcare system and county to predict clinical improvement (% of patients achieving 50% improvement in depressive symptoms) and reach (%CC enrolled among those screening positive) rates. Key predictors were depression screening rate, engagement rate (%CC enrolled patients contacted), psychiatry consultation/treatment optimization rate, clinic size, care manager FTE, and caseload/FTE.

Findings: There were 269 eligible CCMP clinics. In 2022, clinics cared for 4503 patients/quarter; 56.8% were in NYC, 14.4% were early adopters (2012-2014); 16.1% enrolled in 2015-2016, 69.5% 2017-2019; the average caseload was 53.0 patients/FTE, reach 13.0% and clinical improvement 42.0%. In multivariable analyses, key predictors of long-term reach included contact rate (5.28 [2.37,11.72]), FTE (1.02 [1.01,1.02]), caseload/FTE (1.24 [1.18,1.31]), smaller clinic size (0.68 [0.61,0.76]) and earlier adoption (0.44 [0.24,0.77]); while long-term improvement rates were associated with caseload/FTE (1.04 [1.01,1.07]) and psychiatry consultations (1.5 [1.15,1.95]). Reach and effectiveness were negatively associated (0.55 [0.4,0.75]). We developed NYS heatmaps of reach over time to convey progress in targeted interventions.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Our study demonstrates that despite ongoing fiscal and technical assistance strategies, clinics continue to struggle with long-term reach and to a lesser extent effectiveness. Our findings suggest tradeoffs between reach and clinical improvement. Targeting contact rates, FTEs, and caseloads/FTE (which also appeared to positively impact clinical improvement rates), may optimize the pace of sustainability efforts.
